# Changelog

All notable changes to the Claude Code Development Kit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **Refactored Beads documentation architecture** - Aligned with 3-tier documentation system
  - Removed separate `AGENTS.md` file (created duplicate AI context)
  - Created `workflow/ai-context/beads-section.md` as injectable template
  - Beads instructions now injected into `CLAUDE.md` during installation
  - Section 7 "Task Management with Beads" only appears when Beads is selected
  - Updated `commands/bd/README.md` with reference to CLAUDE.md

### Why This Change
- Beads is a CLI tool, not an external AI that reads configuration files
- `AGENTS.md` would only be read by Claude, duplicating `CLAUDE.md` purpose
- Template injection matches the pattern used for `MCP-ASSISTANT-RULES.md`
- Cleaner architecture: one master AI context file per project
