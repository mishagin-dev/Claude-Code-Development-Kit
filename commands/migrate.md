# /migrate

*Multi-agent migration framework for handling version upgrades, database schema changes, framework migrations, and codebase transformations with comprehensive impact analysis.*

## Core Philosophy

This command focuses on **safe, reversible migrations** that minimize risk:
- Analyze impact before making changes
- Create rollback strategies for every migration
- Preserve data integrity throughout
- Validate migrations at each step

### Migration Categories

**Dependency Upgrades**: Major version bumps, framework updates
**Database Migrations**: Schema changes, data transformations
**API Migrations**: Breaking changes, version transitions
**Architecture Migrations**: Structural refactoring, platform changes

## Command Execution

User provided context: "$ARGUMENTS"

### Step 1: Understand Migration Scope

#### Parse the Request
Analyze the natural language input to determine:
1. **Migration type**: Package upgrade, database change, API version, etc.
2. **Source state**: Current version, schema, or structure
3. **Target state**: Desired end state
4. **Constraints**: Downtime tolerance, data sensitivity, rollback requirements

Examples of intent parsing:
- "upgrade to React 19" → Framework major version migration
- "add user roles to database" → Schema migration with data transformation
- "move from REST to GraphQL" → API architecture migration
- "migrate to TypeScript" → Language migration

### Step 2: Impact Analysis

**Migration Impact Analyst Agent**
```
Task: "Analyze the full impact of this migration.

Workflow:
1. Identify all affected components:
   - Direct dependencies
   - Indirect (transitive) dependencies
   - Configuration files
   - Test files
   - Documentation
2. Catalog breaking changes:
   - API changes
   - Behavior changes
   - Removed features
3. Estimate effort and risk
4. Identify external dependencies (CI/CD, monitoring, etc.)

Return comprehensive impact assessment."
```

### Step 3: Multi-Agent Migration Planning

Deploy specialized agents based on migration type:

**Breaking Change Analyzer Agent**
```
Task: "Analyze and catalog all breaking changes.

Workflow:
1. Review changelog/release notes for target version
2. Search codebase for affected patterns
3. For each breaking change:
   - Count occurrences in codebase
   - Assess complexity of fix
   - Check for automated codemods
4. Prioritize by risk and effort

Return breaking changes inventory with fix strategies."
```

**Data Migration Agent** (for database migrations)
```
Task: "Plan data migration strategy.

Workflow:
1. Analyze current schema
2. Define target schema
3. Plan transformation:
   - Additive changes (low risk)
   - Destructive changes (high risk)
   - Data transformation requirements
4. Design rollback strategy
5. Estimate migration duration

Return data migration plan with scripts."
```

**Code Transformation Agent**
```
Task: "Identify and plan code transformations.

Workflow:
1. Find all code patterns requiring changes
2. Categorize transformations:
   - Automated (codemod available)
   - Semi-automated (pattern-based)
   - Manual (requires understanding)
3. Create transformation rules
4. Generate example transformations

Return transformation plan with examples."
```

**Testing Strategy Agent**
```
Task: "Plan migration testing strategy.

Workflow:
1. Identify critical functionality to verify
2. Plan testing phases:
   - Pre-migration baseline
   - During migration validation
   - Post-migration verification
3. Design regression test suite
4. Plan performance comparison

Return testing strategy with checkpoints."
```

**Launch agents in parallel** for comprehensive planning.

### Step 4: Generate Migration Plan

### Step 5: Interactive Follow-up

After presenting plan, offer:
- "Would you like me to execute this migration?"
- "Should I generate the migration scripts?"
- "Do you want me to create the rollback procedures?"
- "Should I run a dry-run first?"

## Migration Patterns

### Blue-Green Migration
For zero-downtime migrations:
1. Deploy new version alongside old
2. Switch traffic gradually
3. Roll back by switching back

### Feature Flags
For gradual rollout:
1. Add feature flag for new code
2. Enable for subset of users
3. Monitor and expand

### Strangler Pattern
For large migrations:
1. Build new alongside old
2. Route requests to new for specific features
3. Gradually migrate all features

## Error Handling

### Migration Failures
- Automatic rollback triggers
- State preservation
- Detailed error logging

### Data Inconsistencies
- Validation checkpoints
- Reconciliation scripts
- Manual review procedures
