# /performance

*Multi-agent performance profiling and optimization analysis that identifies bottlenecks, measures resource usage, and provides actionable optimization recommendations.*

## Core Philosophy

This command focuses on **measurable performance improvements** that impact user experience:
- Identify actual bottlenecks through profiling, not speculation
- Quantify performance impacts with real metrics
- Prioritize optimizations by user-visible impact
- Balance performance gains against code complexity

### Performance Categories

**Critical Path**: User-facing latency and responsiveness
**Resource Usage**: Memory, CPU, I/O consumption
**Scalability**: Performance under load
**Efficiency**: Algorithmic and architectural optimizations

## Command Execution

User provided context: "$ARGUMENTS"

### Step 1: Understand Performance Context

#### Parse the Request
Analyze the natural language input to determine:
1. **Scope**: Specific endpoint, component, or entire application
2. **Symptoms**: Slow response, high memory, timeout issues
3. **Environment**: Development, staging, or production
4. **Baseline**: Any existing performance metrics or expectations

Examples of intent parsing:
- "API is slow" → Profile API endpoints, measure latency
- "memory leak in worker" → Analyze memory allocation patterns
- "database queries" → Focus on query performance
- "general performance audit" → Comprehensive analysis

### Step 2: Detect Performance Tools

Automatically detect available profiling tools:

**JavaScript/TypeScript**:
- Node.js built-in profiler
- Clinic.js (doctor, flame, bubbleprof)
- 0x for flamegraphs
- Chrome DevTools

**Python**:
- cProfile / profile
- py-spy
- memory_profiler
- line_profiler

**Go**:
- pprof (CPU, memory, goroutines)
- trace
- benchmark tests

**Rust**:
- cargo flamegraph
- perf
- Valgrind/Massif

**Database**:
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Query plans
- Index analysis

### Step 3: Multi-Agent Performance Analysis

Deploy specialized agents:

**CPU Profiling Agent**
```
Task: "Analyze CPU usage and identify hot paths.

Workflow:
1. Run CPU profiler on target code
2. Generate flamegraph or hot path analysis
3. Identify:
   - Functions consuming >10% CPU time
   - Recursive or deeply nested calls
   - Synchronous blocking operations
   - Unnecessary computations
4. Calculate potential improvements

Return CPU profile analysis with optimization opportunities."
```

**Memory Analysis Agent**
```
Task: "Analyze memory allocation patterns and identify leaks.

Workflow:
1. Profile memory allocations
2. Identify:
   - Large allocations
   - Frequent small allocations (GC pressure)
   - Growing memory over time (potential leaks)
   - Unbounded data structures
3. Analyze object lifecycle
4. Check for circular references

Return memory profile with leak suspects and optimization recommendations."
```

**I/O and Latency Agent**
```
Task: "Analyze I/O operations and latency sources.

Workflow:
1. Profile database queries
2. Analyze external API calls
3. Identify:
   - N+1 query patterns
   - Missing indexes
   - Slow external dependencies
   - Synchronous I/O in hot paths
   - Missing caching opportunities
4. Measure latency distribution

Return I/O analysis with specific optimization targets."
```

**Algorithm Analysis Agent**
```
Task: "Review algorithmic efficiency of critical code paths.

Workflow:
1. Analyze complexity of key algorithms
2. Identify:
   - O(n²) or worse operations on large datasets
   - Inefficient data structure choices
   - Redundant computations
   - Missing early termination opportunities
3. Suggest algorithmic improvements

Return complexity analysis with refactoring recommendations."
```

**Launch agents in parallel** for comprehensive analysis.

### Step 4: Benchmark and Validate

For suggested optimizations:
1. Establish baseline measurements
2. Predict improvement potential
3. Identify any trade-offs

### Step 5: Generate Performance Report

## Implementation Notes

1. **Use non-invasive profiling** when possible
2. **Profile in production-like conditions** for accuracy
3. **Consider warm-up time** when benchmarking
4. **Account for variance** in measurements
5. **Preserve code readability** when optimizing
